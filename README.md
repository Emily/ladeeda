Ladeeda
=======
Ladeeda is not intended for actual use. It could potentially be a good starting point for a real billing system, however it was intended to test my own ability to estimate project time as explained in the backstory below.

Backstory
---------
I once was talking with someone about billing systems. We disagreed a bit. I was also told that I was "severely underestimating the complexity of billing systems". Seeing as the person I was talking with had written a billing system and I hadn't I figured it was possible that I was indeed incorrect in my estimation. I started Ladeeda to gauge my own estimation of project complexity and design time.

Though I haven't completely implemented Ladeeda, I got the information I wanted out of it: the aforementioned gauging and a fun programming exercise. I spent about 6 hours on Ladeeda, most of it trying to figure out ActiveMerchant and the Authorize.net APIs.
